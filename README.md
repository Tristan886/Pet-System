# Pet-System
Pet System is a Roblox inventory framework that updates in real time and securely saves data with DataStores. Players can collect pets, equip or unequip them, and see them dynamically follow behind in a strategic tailing formation, with the closest pet up front and others fading back. The system also includes flexible selling options, allowing pets to be sold individually or in bulk.
