# Pet-System

**Pet System** is a Roblox showcase project featuring a functional pet inventory that updates in real time and securely saves data with DataStores. Players can equip, unequip, and sell pets, and equipped pets follow the player in a tailing formation where the closest pet stays up front and others fade back. The system blends clean UI, persistence, and dynamic follower behavior into one complete package.
